# Name/type Mismatch

## Description

The name of a function strongly suggests a return type, but the function has a different type.

Alternatively, the name of a parameter suggests a type, but the parameter has a different type.

Alternatively, the name of a field strongly suggests its type, but the field has a different type.

## Examples and subtypes

Perhaps the most infamous example of this antipattern is `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST`. Many programmers assumed this parameter took a boolean and supplied `true`. In fact, it took either `0`, `1`, or `2`, where only `2` provided full security. Since `true` is equivalent to `1` in C, the many programs which supplied `true` were vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. This is described in a paper called [The Most Dangerous Code in the World](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_ccs12.pdf).

Outside of that, this antipattern contains as special cases a majority of the antipatterns catalogued by Arnaoudova's original work. It includes:


* [A.2] Methods of the form "isSomething" whose return is not a boolean
* [A.3] Methods of the form "setSomething" with a non-void return type (not explained in documentation)
* [A.4] Methods whose name is singular, but which return a collection
* [B.4] Methods whose name is a predicate (like "shouldFoo"), but whose return is not a boolean
* [B.6] Methods whose name is plural, which which do not return a collection.
  * A few exceptions have been noted, such as people expecting that the name `getBounds` returns a `Dimension`.
* [C.1] The method name contains an antonym of a word in its return type (e.g.: `ControlEnableState disable(...)`, example found in Eclipse 1.0).nnn
* [D.1] Field name which is singular but which is actually a collection (e.g.: `Vector target`).
* [D.2] Field name suggests a boolean, but type is non-boolean (e.g.: `int[] reached`).
* [E.1] Field name is plural, but its type is not a collection (e.g.: `boolean _stats`, example found in ArgoUML 0.10.1).
* [F.1] Field name and type contain antonyms (such as the declaration `MAssociationEnd start`, example found in ArgoUML 0.10.1).

## Discussion and Lessons

For writing code, this anti-pattern is relatively benign in languages with strict typing rules. If code is written incorrectly expecting the wrong type, it is unlikely to compile. But as seen above, in cases where it does, such as caused by C allowing confusion of integers, booleans, and enums, the cost can be deadly.

In languages with looser typing constraints, code which mistakenly assumes the wrong type is more likely to linger. A potentially-deadly example: writing code like `if shouldFoo()` where `shouldFoo()` returns an object rather than a boolean. In Ruby or Python, this code will look correct, but in fact the if-statement will always be taken.
