# Missing implied return type

## Description

The name of a function strongly suggests a return type, but the function has no return value

## Examples and subtypes

This antipattern contains as special cases many of the antipatterns catalogued by Arnaoudova's original work. It includes:

* [B.2] "Validation" methods with "check" or "validate" in their name that neither return a value nor raise an exception. Example (`UMLComboBox.checkCollision` from ArgoUML):

```java
public void checkCollision(final String before,
                           final String after) {
    final boolean collision = before != null
           && before.equals(this._shortName) || after != null
           && after.equals(this._shortName);
    if (collision) {
        if (this._longName == null) {
            this._longName = this.getLongName();
        }
        this._displayName = this._longName;
    }
}
```

* [B.3] Methods of the form "getSomething" which do not return a value. Example (from Eclipse 1.0):

```java
protected void getMethodBodies(
        final CompilationUnitDeclaration unit,
        final int place) {
    // fill the methods bodies in order for the code
    // to be generated
    if (unit.ignoreMethodBodies) {
        unit.ignoreFurtherInvestigation = true;
        return; // if initial diet parse did not work,
        // no need to dig into method bodies.
    }
    if (place < this.parseThreshold) {
        return; // work already done ...
    }
    // real parse of the method....
    this.parser.scanner
           .setSourceBuffer(
                   unit.compilationResult.compilationUnit
                   .getContents());
    if (unit.types != null) {
        for (int i = unit.types.length; --i >= 0;) {
             unit.types[i].parseMethod(this.parser, unit);
        }
    }
}
```

* [B.5] Methods whose name suggests a transformation do not return a value (and where the documentation does not explain where the result is stored). Example:

```java
public void javaToNative(final Object object,
            final TransferData transferData) {
    final byte[] check =
            LocalSelectionTransfer.TYPE_NAME.getBytes();
    super.javaToNative(check, transferData);
}
```


* [B.7] A method named `getSomething` returns nothing. (This one is absent from Arnaoudova's first papers, but is present in [the 2018 paper](http://veneraarnaoudova.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2018-ICPC-Effect-lexicon-cognitive-load.pdf).)

## Discussion and Lessons

This anti-pattern is relatively benign, at least in a statically typed language: a program which attempts to use the nonexistent return value cannot be written. But outside of being intrinsically confusing, it also suggests the codebase relies too heavily on mutation. A discussion of the perils of mutable code is outside the scope of this document.
